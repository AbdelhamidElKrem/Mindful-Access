# Privacy Policy for Mindful Access (Taqwa Timekeeper)

**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025

## Introduction
Mindful Access ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Chrome Extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

### Location Data (Optional)
- **What:** We may request access to your geographic location (latitude and longitude).
- **Why:** To calculate accurate prayer times for your specific area.
- **How it is used:** 
  - Your coordinates are sent to the **Aladhan API** to fetch prayer schedules.
  - Your coordinates are sent to **BigDataCloud API** to determine your city name for display purposes.
  - This processing happens transiently; we do not store your location history on any external server.

### User Preferences
- **What:** Settings such as blocked websites, prayer calculation method, and preferred language.
- **Why:** To provide the core functionality of the extension (blocking sites, showing correct times).
- **Storage:** All preferences are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`.

## 2. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. 

- **External APIs:** The extension interacts with the following third-party services to function:
  - **Aladhan API:** For prayer times.
  - **BigDataCloud API:** For city name detection.
  - These services receive your IP address or coordinates solely to provide the requested data.

## 3. Data Retention
Everything is stored locally on your browser. Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data immediately.

## 4. Your Rights
You can revoke location permissions at any time via your browser settings. You can also manually enter your city/country or coordinates in the extension settings instead of using GPS.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
