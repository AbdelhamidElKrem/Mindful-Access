## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent & Intentional Blocking**
We don't just block; we facilitate **intention**.
- **The "Pause" Moment**: When you visit a distracting site (e.g., YouTube, Facebook), you aren't met with a harsh error screen. Instead, a beautiful, calming "Intention Screen" appears.
- **Mindful Intervention**: The extension asks, *"Is this beneficial?"* forcing a moment of reflection.
- **Flexible Control**:
    - **Yes**: If the visit is intentional, you can choose a specific duration (15, 30, 45, or 60 mins).
    - **No**: If it was a habit, you can close the tab and return to work.
- **Emergency Access**: Life happens. A discreet "Emergency Continue" option ensures you're never locked out of critical tasks when absolutely necessary.

### 2. **Advanced Focus Mode 🎯**
For deep work sessions where distractions are not an option.
