# Taqwa Timekeeper: Reclaim Your Time, Respect Your Prayer.

**Taqwa Timekeeper** is more than just a website blocker; it is a digital companion designed to help you align your digital habits with your values. In a world of endless scrolling and distractions, this extension brings **intention** back to your browsing.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Intentional Browsing**
Instead of mindlessly opening social media or entertainment sites, Taqwa Timekeeper gently pauses you.
- **The Check**: When you try to visit a blocked site (like YouTube or Facebook), you are greeted with a calm, beautiful screen.
- **The Question**: It asks: *"Is this beneficial?"* or *"How long do you need?"*
- **The Choice**: You can choose to proceed for a specific time (e.g., 15 mins) if it's necessary, or close the tab if it's just a distraction.

### 2. **Focus Mode 🎯**
Need to get deep work done? Turn on **Focus Mode**.
- **Strict Blocking**: All distractions are locked down. The "continue" option is harder to reach.
- **Timer**: Set a focus session for 30, 60, or any number of minutes.
- **Visuals**: A countdown timer keeps you on track.

### 3. **Prayer Time Integration 🕌**
Never miss a prayer because you were lost in a screen.
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically finds accurate prayer times for your city (via GPS or manual entry).
- **Gentle Reminders**: Receive a silent notification **5 minutes before** every prayer.
- **Prayer Break**: During prayer times (for 20 mins), the extension encourages you to take a break. Access to distractions is strictly paused to help you prepare for Salah.

### 4. **Emergency Access**
We know life happens. If you absolutely need to access a site during a block, a discreet "Emergency Continue" option is available to give you immediate access without hassle, but only when you truly need it.

## 🎨 Premium Design
Enjoy a beautiful, calming interface featuring:
- **Deep Emerald & Gold Theme**: Elegant and serious.
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern, frosted-glass visuals.
- **English & Arabic**: Fully localized for your preference.
